# GUI toolkit
# tkinter is part of the Python standard library on many platforms but
# often provided by a system package on Linux (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu: python3-tk).
# Installing via pip is not recommended; if you need it on Linux, install the
# system package or add the appropriate conda package (e.g. `tk` / `python-tk`).
# Keep this commented here as a reminder for system-level install.

# C++ interop options
# pybind11 - used to write C++ extension modules that are compiled and

# writing/compiling extensions in some cases; optional alternative.
